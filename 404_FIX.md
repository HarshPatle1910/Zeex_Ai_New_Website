# 404 Error Fix - Root Route Added

## Problem
When accessing `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in the browser, you get a 404 error because there was no root route defined.

## Solution
Added a root route (`/`) to the backend that returns API information.

## What Changed
- Added root endpoint at `/` that shows:
  - API name and status
  - List of available endpoints
  - Version information

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Restart the Backend Server

If the backend is currently running, you need to restart it:

1. **Stop the current server:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the backend is running
   - Or close the terminal window

2. **Start the backend again:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```

### Step 2: Test the Root Route

After restarting, visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser. You should now see:
```json
{
  "message": "Zeex AI Backend API",
  "status": "running",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "endpoints": {
    "health": "/health",
    "contact": "/contact (POST)",
    "applications": "/api/applications/ (POST)",
    "check_data": "/api/check-data (GET)",
    "media": "/media/<filename> (GET)"
  }
}
```

## Available Endpoints

Now you can access:

1. **Root:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` - API information
2. **Health Check:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` - Server status
3. **Contact Form:** `POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/contact`
4. **Job Applications:** `POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/applications/`
5. **Get Applications:** `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/check-data`

## Important Notes

- The backend server must be **restarted** for changes to take effect
- If you're using Flask's debug mode, it should auto-reload, but a manual restart is safer
- The 404 error should now be resolved when accessing the root URL

## Quick Test

After restarting, try these URLs in your browser:

✅ `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` - Should show API info (no more 404!)
✅ `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` - Should show `{"status": "ok"}`

The 404 error is now fixed! 🎉
